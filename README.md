# shara (DISCONTINUED)
Shara is an automatic keyboard and mouse clicker built in Python. 

I made this because a homogenous tit farms ROBLOX games for fun and because apparently she uses her mouse manually when farming which is dogballs. I also didn't trust other keyboard and mouse autoclickers that I found online so I decided to create one because why not.


# Future Development
> I might add a GUI or something because Shahara is too inept to use 2 simple commands.
- Add logo to .exe application
- Fix walk and movement bodge
- Add betterGUI
- Drink less coffee
